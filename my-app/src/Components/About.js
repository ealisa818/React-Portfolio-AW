        <><div className="About">About</div><div className="writing"> After teaching English to speakers of other languages for over 15 years, I decided to make a career change to Web Development. Before teaching, I earned a degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Georgia. I am looking for an opportunity where I can use both my analytical thinking and problem solving skills. While teaching, I have always taken on leadership roles in the schools where I worked, including acting as teacher/administration liason, as well as being the district wide department leader. In Germany, together with a business partner, I started and ran Hamburg Language Lounge, a language school combined with a bar/café. I love learning about new cultures and studying languages. I am fluent in German.
